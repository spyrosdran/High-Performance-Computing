## How to compile and run the code
âœ¨ You may use whichever compiler you prefer, but here I'm going to use gcc

ðŸ‘‰ To compile a file:
```gcc -fopenmp <file> -o <output_file_name>```

ðŸ‘‰ To run the code:
```<output_file_name> <...>```

âš¡To further speedup the code, you may use the O2 optimization when compiling the file:
```gcc -fopenmp -O2 <file> -o <output_file_name>```
